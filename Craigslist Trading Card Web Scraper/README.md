# Craigslist-TCG-Scraper

This script scrapes Craigslist for Pokemon, Magic the Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh! card listings within 10 miles of Hoboken, NJ (07030). Additionally, this script writes these Craigslist listings to a MySQL database so that the script can reference old listings to determine which ones are new. The script creates a dataframe of new Craigslist listings which are sent via email everytime the script determines that new listings are available. The script can be scheduled to automatlically run using a cron job. Please reference the Jupyter notebook (CL_TCG_FINAL.ipynb) for the fully annotated script. This was my first project using python, so there is definitely room for improvement. Feel free to propose changes to this project or take any code that will help you advance further on your projects. Thanks for checking this out.
